# Snake Game

A simple **Snake Game** built using Python's `tkinter` library. In this game, you control a snake that grows longer by eating food while avoiding collisions with itself and the game boundaries.

- Simple controls: Use arrow keys to move the snake (**Up**, **Down**, **Left**, **Right**).
- Score tracking.
- Game over display when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.
